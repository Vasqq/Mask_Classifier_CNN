### Mask classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network

   ## Goal of the project:

Develop a system using AI that can analyze images of faces and detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, as well as the type of mask that is being worn.

   ## Description of the project:
   
The project was developed in Python using primarily the Pytorch and Skorch libraries. The system relies on an architecture of deep neural networks known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which are a category of neural nets that are very good at classifying images. The network uses supervised learning to train the CNN, training the AI with images from four different categories: people wearing no masks, cloth masks, surgical masks or N95 masks. Once the network is trained, you can now pass in new images of people wearing a mask or not. The network will now be able to classify these new images into the correct category with an accuracy of around 90%.

Some other libraries used include NumPy, Matplotlib and SkLearn.
